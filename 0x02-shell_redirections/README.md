In this project I am going to be writing some script on shell redirection
The file '0-hello_world' prints hello world followed by a new line
The script '1-confused_smiley' prints a confused emoji
The file '2-hellofile' displays the contents of /etc/passwd' 
The script '3-twofiles' display the contents of two directories
The script '4-lastlines' displays the lines of etc/passwd
The file '5-firstlines' displays the first ten lines of the file /etc/passwd
